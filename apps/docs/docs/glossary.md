# Glossary

Blockchain is a new technology that many might not be familiar with. There are other terms in parapsychology that many are just now getting familiar with. This page lists terms and friendly explanations.

## ESP
Short form acronym of Extra-Sensory Perception
## EVM
The Ethereum Virtual Machine is a standard set of machine instructions that Ethereum validating software takes part in executing as a network activity. The set of instructions are well specified and standardized so the network is able to validate and come to a consensus on computing the next valid state from block to block.

## Hash Functions
Hashing or a hash function is a one-way mathematical transformation of an input, like a word, into a sequence of numbers and letters. Only the same precise input will produce the same output. If even one character or letter or number is changed, the hash function will produce an entirely different output. This means unless the input is known, the hash output is meaningless. The hash function is how the `Session` `target` is kept secret on-chain.

## Solidity
Solidity is a high-level programming language used to code software that executes within the [EVM](#evm) environment.
